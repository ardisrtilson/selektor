Selektor is a platform for DJs and producers to exchange digital drum samples for music production and live sets. 
Most drum sample websites are top-down distribution, require money to purchase samples and lack a social element. 
Since production is a highly collaborative and social process, I aim to fill the need for a more egalitarian, 
evenly distributed, open-source approach to sample sharing and exchange.

The app allows users to preview and then either rate or favorite selected samples to download for use in their own music. 
Users can create an account from which to upload and share their own samples. Users can add others as friends and comment 
on samples uploaded by their friends in order to offer constructive feedback.
